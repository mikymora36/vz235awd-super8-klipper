#verbose: no
#   Set to yes to enable debug output. The default is no.

[cartographer scan]
probe_speed: 5
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.

#   Number of runs when doing a scan mesh.
#   Consecutive runs will trace back the way it came from.

[z_tilt]
z_positions: 0, 115
            230, 115
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
points: 15, 90
        215, 90
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.

#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 3
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.05
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.

[screws_tilt_adjust]
screw1: 30, 5
#   The (X, Y) coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to so that the probe is directly
#   above the bed screw (or as close as possible while still being
#   above the bed). This is the base screw used in calculations. This
#   parameter must be provided.
screw1_name: FRONT LEFT
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.

#...
#   Additional bed leveling screws. At least two screws must be
#   defined.
speed: 250
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 3
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
screw_thread: CW-M3
#   The type of screw used for bed leveling, M3, M4, or M5, and the
#   rotation direction of the knob that is used to level the bed.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
#   Default value is CW-M3 which most printers use. A clockwise
#   rotation of the knob decreases the gap between the nozzle and the
#   bed. Conversely, a counter-clockwise rotation increases the gap.

[bed_mesh]
zero_reference_position: 115, 115

calibrate_start_x: 20

#   This should be the X coordinate that positions the nozzle at the starting

calibrate_end_x: 210
#   Defines the maximum X coordinate of the calibration
#   This should be the X coordinate that positions the nozzle at the ending

#   This should be the Y coordinate that positions the nozzle during the

#   be near the center of the bed

# For Y-axis twist compensation, specify the following parameters:
calibrate_start_y: 35
#   Defines the minimum Y coordinate of the calibration
#   This should be the Y coordinate that positions the nozzle at the starting
#   calibration position for the Y axis. This parameter must be provided if
#   compensating for Y axis twist.
calibrate_end_y: 165.75
#   Defines the maximum Y coordinate of the calibration
#   This should be the Y coordinate that positions the nozzle at the ending
#   calibration position for the Y axis. This parameter must be provided if
#   compensating for Y axis twist.
calibrate_x: 115
#   Defines the X coordinate of the calibration for Y axis twist compensation
#   This should be the X coordinate that positions the nozzle during the
#   calibration process for Y axis twist compensation. This parameter must be
#   provided and is recommended to be near the center of the bed.

[shaketune]
result_folder: ~/printer_data/config/ShakeTune_results
#    Path where the processed results will be stored. If the folder doesn't exist,
#    it will be automatically created. You can change this if you'd like to store 
#    results in a different location.
number_of_results_to_keep: 5
#    This setting defines how many results you want to keep in the result folder.
#    Once the specified number is exceeded, older results will be automatically deleted
#    to free up space on the SD card and avoid cluttering the results folder.
# keep_raw_data: False
#    If set to True, Shake&Tune will store both the processed graphs and the raw accelerometer
#    .stdata files in the results folder. This can be useful for debugging or archiving purposes.
#    Please always attach them when reporting any issues on GitHub or Discord.
show_macros_in_webui: True
#    Mainsail and Fluidd doesn't create buttons for system commands (macros that are not part
#    of the printer.cfg file). This option allow Shake&Tune to inject them into the webui at runtime.
#    If set to False, the macros will be hidden but still accessible from the console by typing
#    their names manually, which can be useful if you prefer to encapsulate them into your own macros.
timeout: 600
#    This defines the maximum processing time (in seconds) to allows to Shake&Tune for generating 
#    graphs from a .stdata file. 10 minutes should be more than enough in most cases, but if you have
#    slower hardware (e.g., older SD cards or low-performance devices), increase it to prevent timeouts.
# measurements_chunk_size: 2
#    Each Shake&Tune command uses the accelerometer to take multiple measurements. By default,
#    Shake&Tune will write a chunk of data to disk every two measurements, and at the end of the
#    command will merge these chunks into the final .stdata file for processing. "2" is a very
#    conservative setting to avoid Klipper Timer Too Close errors on lower end devices with little
#    RAM, and should work for everyone. However, if you are using a powerful computer, you may
#    wish to increase this value to keep more measurements in memory (e.g., 15-20) before writing
#    the chunk and avoid stressing the filesystem too much.
# max_freq: 200
#    This setting defines the maximum frequency at which the calculation of the power spectral density
#    is cutoff. The default value should be fine for most machines and accelerometer combinations and
#    avoid touching it unless you know what you're doing.
# dpi: 300
#    Controls the resolution of the generated graphs. The default value of 300 dpi was optimized
#    and strikes a balance between performance and readability, ensuring that graphs are clear
#    without using too much RAM to generate them. Usually, you shouldn't need to change this value.
